## 1.Understand
- Know exactly what is being asked.
- When you can explain the problem in plan english, you understand the problem.

> “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman
 
 - You should always:
   - write down the problem
   - draw a diagram
   - or talk to someone or something (rubber duck)

## 2.Plan
- Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
- Answer the question : 
  - “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”
   - Write down the exact steps
 
 
 ## 3.Divide 
 - Break the problem down into sub-problems these will be easier to solve.
 - Solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest.
 - Once each sub-problem is solved, connect the dots.

Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem

 ## 4. Stuck? 
 1. Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
 
 
> “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to   do.”
> — Andrew Singer
 
 2. Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
 
 - Sidenote: Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes. I’m serious. You’ll be dumbfounded at how effective this is.
 
3. Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

- Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.
 
 ## Don't forget lots of practice!
